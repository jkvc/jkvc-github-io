I am a current master candidate in computer science at Stanford University. I my areas of interests are machine learning, computer vision, computational natural language and social science.

I study and work to fill the various gaps between compurters and human. My goal is to explore the field where machine learning intersects with the human society, and build ML systems that help us understand ourselves better.

Here's a [one-page pdf resume](https://github.com/jkvc/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).
